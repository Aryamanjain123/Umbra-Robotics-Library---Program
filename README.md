# vexlib â€” Advanced VEX Robotics Library

`vexlib` is a competition-ready robotics library for VEX robots, designed to make autonomous and driver-control code **clean, powerful, and simple**.  

Features include:
- âœ… PID++ (settling, anti-windup, slew, filters, telemetry)
- âœ… Feedforward (kS, kV, kA) with auto-fitting
- âœ… Motion profiles (trapezoid + S-curve)
- âœ… Trajectory follower with events
- âœ… Odometry++ (3-wheel + IMU fusion + GPS correction)
- âœ… Pose math (SE(2), mirroring, transforms)
- âœ… Telemetry (ring buffer, CSV logging to SD)
- âœ… Hardware support (pneumatics, vision pipelines)
